# Starter Software Developer Portfolio


## Purpose 

This is intended to be a ==starter== portfolio for software developers. It will need to be customized to match the developers skill set.
The reason behind this template is to take away some of the time consumption that developers use trying to create a portfolio and spend more of that 
time building projects. I have added some commnets inside of the files that tells what each section is doing and what needs to be edited. It is pretty simple and meant to be used as a first time guide as youre building up your skills

## Technology Usde

The technology uses is pretty simple, the front end is build in ==React== and using the ==Bootsrap framework==.
