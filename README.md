# Starter Software Developer Portfolio


[![Read Me](my-app/src/components/image/imagePlaceHolder.jpeg)])


## Purpose 

This is intended to be a starter portfolio for software developers. It will need to be customized to match the developer's skill set.
The reason behind this template is to take away some of the time consumption that developers use to create a portfolio and spend more of that 
time building projects. I have added some comments inside of the files that tells what each section is doing and what needs to be edited. It is pretty simple and meant to be used as a first-time guide as you build up your skills

## Technology Used

The technology uses is pretty simple, the front end is built in React and uses the Bootstrap framework.
